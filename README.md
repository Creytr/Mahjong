# Mahjong
Mahjong in GoLang
This was a project I created for my Computer Programming class in high school where we had to make a program in a language that we hadn't learned about yet (no java, C, or C++).

I wanted to create this game because I thought it would be cool to be able to play this relatively obscure game outside the Chinese culture.

It's not completely done yet as I still have not made a GUI for it and looking back at it, I could document/split the code so it becomes much clearer to read.
